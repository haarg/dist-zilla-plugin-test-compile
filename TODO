[@Author::ETHER/PHASE VERIFICATION] prereqs have already been read from after munging phase!
    --> fixed when this ships:
        https://github.com/jquelin/dist-zilla-plugin-prepender/pull/4

[@Author::ETHER/ModuleBuildTiny::Fallback] something else changed the content of the Module::Build::Tiny version of Build.PL -- maybe you should switch back to [ModuleBuildTiny]?
    --> it is Prepender.
    solution: run after bundle munges Build.PL, and update [MBT::Fallback] to
    do its work (when possible) in munge_files, not setup_installer.
