 - now properly handling filenames with non-ascii characters

2.018     2013-08-04 03:25:37 Europe/Paris
 - delay inserting the list of modules to check until after all plugins have
   had an opportunity to add files (found via RT#87562)

   script compilation checks

2.017     2013-08-03 19:06:44 Europe/Paris
 - fix conflicts metadata entry for Test::Kwalitee::Extra (I misinterpreted
   the metaspec as to what conflicts actually means!)

 - convert Foo\Bar.pm to Foo/Bar.pm for proper %INC retrieval on win32

2.013     2013-07-30 20:54:52 Europe/Paris
 - .pm files are tested with -Mblib again; 2.012 was a mistake.
 - now require()ing files without the leading lib/, to avoid potentially
   loading files twice (a problem since 2.009) - thanks dolmen and haarg!

2.012     2013-07-30 20:12:53 Europe/Paris
 - .pm files are once again tested with -Ilib, instead of -Mblib, to avoid
   potentially loading files twice (this was changed in 2.009).

2.011     2013-07-28 23:45:53 Europe/Paris
 - .pod files are now always omitted from the list of found modules in the
   dist (thanks for the report, Alberto Simões!)

2.010     2013-07-27 01:45:51 Europe/Paris
 - add conflicts metadata for Test::Kwalitee::Extra, which does not like the
   require() syntax we use
 - all changes since 2.002 now as a stable release:

   [FEATURES]
   - new fail_on_warning option
   - the 'skip' option can now be provided multiple times
   - calculate the list of files to check at build time, rather than using
     File::Find at runtime; the filefinders used are configurable.

   [IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS]
   - include a comment in the generated test indicating how it was generated
   - modules used by the test are injected as test requires dependencies.
   - avoid trying to load Test::Script if there are no scripts to check
   - we now load the .pm file, rather than attempting to calculate the module
     name and then loading that
   - if there are scripts to be tested, Test::Script is now mandatory;
     accurate prerequisites are injected into the dist in all cases
   - properly inject all used modules as test prerequisites
   - now using Text::Template to generate the test, for simpler munging code
